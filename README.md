### üì£ Some notes
**AFTER THE BUILD U _CAN_ DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY EXCEPT THE EXE FILE!**<br>
 This project was created for educational purposes only, so please do not use it to harm and damage;
 This project was started because I wanted to learn about Discord's infrastructure and possible exploits, mean-while I made the base of this token-grabber (like a year ago) but, not long ago I continued this project and this is the final result, of course, I will update it and add more features in the future but mean-while remember to use your power for the good üò≤.
 if you liked it consider to ‚≠ê this project and üïµÔ∏è (follow) me ü§î.

To be protected against token grabbers, you are more than welcome to install my Anti-Token-Grabber which is located on my GitHub. [I will upload it later meanwhile try https://github.com/andro2157/DiscordTokenProtector although this grabber bypassing it, other grabbers are not]
