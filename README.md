### 📣 Some notes
**AFTER THE BUILD U _CAN_ DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY EXCEPT THE EXE FILE!**<br>
 This project was created for educational purposes only, so please do not use it to harm and damage;
 This project was started because I wanted to learn about Discord's infrastructure and possible exploits, mean-while I made the base of this token-grabber (like a year ago) but, not long ago I continued this project and this is the final result, of course, I will update it and add more features in the future but mean-while remember to use your power for the good 😲.
 if you liked it consider to ⭐ this project and 🕵️ (follow) me 🤔.
