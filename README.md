# 🔥 Qvoid-Token-Grabber
 Advanced grabber that grabs browser passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens with the computer information.
### 🐵 Features
   - [x] Discord webhooks integration. 
   - [x] Grabs tokens from all installed clients even if the main path changed and deletes accounts duplicates.
   - [x] 18 hardcoded known tokens locations.
   - [x] Grabs PC information + token information (IP, CPU, GPU, WINKEY).
   - [x] Sends screenshot of all screens at the moment of the grabbing.
   - [x] Grabs browser cookies and passwords.
   - [x] Supports Brave, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and OperaGx. [Password & Cookies stealer]
   - [x] Self-updating, When a new account is logged or password changed will be sent again with the new information.
   - [x] Bypasses (User-mode unless the grabber running as administrator) Anti-Token-Grabbers.
   - [x] Supports grabbing from Firefox-based browsers (Pale Moon, WaterFox, Firefox [I will add more in the future]) <br><br>
   - [ ]  Local cache.
   - [ ]  18 hardcoded paths 😕 (Because I prefer dynamic).
   - [ ]  Works pretty slow (18 seconds on average) because it was taking lots of CPU usage, now it's pretty silent and should work at the same time for all CPUs.
 
### 📣 Some notes
 This project was created for educational purposes only, so please do not use it to harm and damage;
 This project was started because I wanted to learn about Discord's infrastructure and possible exploits, mean-while I made the base of this token-grabber (like a year ago) but, not long ago I continued this project and this is the final result, of course, I will update it and add more features in the future but mean-while remember to use your power for the good 😲.
 if you liked it consider to ⭐ this project and 🕵️ (follow) me 🤔.
 
### ⛔ What can I do against token grabbers?
To be protected against token grabbers, you are more than welcome to install my Anti-Token-Grabber which is located on my GitHub. [I will upload it later meanwhile try https://github.com/andro2157/DiscordTokenProtector although this grabber is bypassing it, other grabbers not]
